# NS COVID Data

Our World in Data [developed some nice charts](https://ourworldindata.org/covid-metrics-previous-waves) that showed the number of hospitalizations compared to the number of cases for some locations. I wondered how that would look for Nova Scotia, so I put together a chart. I'd been poking at different libraries to generate this. I started with D3, and then used C3 on top of it. I might also use some other libraries in the future.

You can view the chart here: https://anderegg.ca/ns-covid-data/

And the original D3 version here: https://anderegg.ca/ns-covid-data/d3/
