# NS COVID Data

Our World in Data developed some nice charts that showed the number of hospitalizations compared to the number of cases for some locations. I wondered how that would look for Nova Scotia, so I put together a chart. I'd been poking at different libraries to generate this. I started with D3, and then used C3 on top of it. I might also use some other libraries in the future.
