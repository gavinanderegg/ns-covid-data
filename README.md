# NS COVID Data

**Note:** as of Feb 28, 2022 I'm going to stop updating this regularly, as the provincial data is now coming out sporadically. Over the last 10 days I've had to interpolate some of the data. If things stop looking like they're on a downward trend, I'll update this to work with weekly data instead.

Our World in Data [developed some nice charts](https://ourworldindata.org/covid-metrics-previous-waves) that showed the number of hospitalizations compared to the number of cases for some locations. I wondered how that would look for Nova Scotia, so I put together a chart. I'd been poking at different libraries to generate this. I started with D3, and then used C3 on top of it. I might also use some other libraries in the future.

You can view the chart here: https://anderegg.ca/ns-covid-data/

And the original D3 version here: https://anderegg.ca/ns-covid-data/d3/
